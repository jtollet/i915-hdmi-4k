Hi Ville,

Thanks for the feedback! You were absolutely right to question the placement
of the delay. I've systematically tested moving the delay earlier in the
modeset sequence as you suggested, and the results are quite revealing.

Test Methodology:
I created 4 test patches, progressively moving the 150ms delay earlier in the
intel_ddi_enable_hdmi() sequence:

- Test 1: Before intel_ddi_buf_enable() (line ~3504) - SUCCESS
- Test 2: Before intel_ddi_power_up_lanes() (line ~3466) - SUCCESS  
- Test 3: After set_signal_levels() (line ~3429) - SUCCESS
- Test 4: After hsw_prepare_hdmi_ddi_buffers() (line ~3424) - SUCCESS

Results:
All four tests succeeded! The 4K@60Hz display initialized correctly regardless
of where the delay was placed in the sequence.

Interpretation:
This suggests the timing is NOT tied to any specific PHY/DDI operation.
Instead, the monitor needs ~150ms to process the initial SCDC configuration
sent by intel_hdmi_handle_sink_scrambling() before any subsequent operations
begin.

The HDMI 2.0 spec (section 10.4.1.7) mentions monitors can disable scrambling
if they don't detect a scrambled signal within 100ms. It appears some monitors
need additional time to PREPARE their scrambling detection logic, not just to
detect the signal itself.

Recommendation:
Given these results, I've submitted a v2 patch that places the delay
immediately after intel_hdmi_handle_sink_scrambling() (earliest possible
point). This makes the code intent clear: we're giving the monitor time to
process SCDC configuration before PHY initialization begins.

If you'd like, I can also test with shorter delays (100ms, 125ms) to find
the minimum required value for this specific monitor.

Best regards,
Jerome

Hardware tested:
- Intel Alder Lake-N N100 (Gen 12.0)
- Cisco Desk Pro monitor (HDMI 2.0)
- 3840x2160@60Hz (594 MHz, scrambling enabled)
