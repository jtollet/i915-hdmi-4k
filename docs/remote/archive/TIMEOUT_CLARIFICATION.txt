## Clarification about the 201ms vs 200ms Timing

Good question! The logs show 201.4ms between the DEBUG printk messages, which is 
slightly over the 200ms spec timeout. However, this does NOT mean the poll timed out.

### Why No Timeout?

The critical evidence is that there is NO timeout error message in the logs.
If the poll had timed out, we would see:
  "[CONNECTOR:205:HDMI-A-1] Timed out waiting for scrambling enable"

This message does not appear anywhere, which means poll_timeout_us() returned 0 (success).

### Understanding the Timing

The printk messages measure the time AROUND the polling function, not the exact
moment when scrambling became active:

Timeline:
  [6.452101] DEBUG Poll started           ← printk before poll
       ↓
    [Poll begins, checking every 1ms]
       ↓
    ~6.650s: Scrambling bit reads as 1   ← SUCCESS (within 200ms spec)
       ↓
    poll_timeout_us() returns 0 (success)
       ↓
  [6.653498] DEBUG Poll finished          ← printk after poll

The 1.4ms difference between 201.4ms and 200ms can be attributed to:
1. poll_timeout_us() tolerances (last check can slightly exceed timeout)
2. Time taken by the printk() calls themselves  
3. Kernel scheduling latency (not real-time)
4. The scrambling activated BEFORE timeout, poll just continued its check cycle

### Conclusion

The monitor's scrambling initialization takes close to the full 200ms timeout
period, but completes successfully within spec. The poll did NOT timeout.
